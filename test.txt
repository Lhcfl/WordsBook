Going to British high school for one year was a very enjoyable and exciting experience for me. I was very happy with the school hours in Britain because school starts around 9 a.m. and ends about 3.30 p.m. This means I could get up an hour later than usual, as schools in China begin before 8 a.m.
I was very lucky to experience this different way of life. I look back on my time in UK with satisfaction, and I really hope to go back and study in Manchester again.
